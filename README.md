# Cisco-Router-Configuration-for-Syslog-NTP-and-SSH-Operations

Project Overview
This project involved configuring Cisco routers to support Syslog for centralized logging, Network Time Protocol (NTP) for accurate time synchronization, and Secure Shell (SSH) for secure remote management. The configuration aimed to enhance network security and operational efficiency across multiple devices.
Business Understanding
In modern network environments, maintaining accurate logs, synchronized time, and secure management is crucial for ensuring reliability and security. Implementing Syslog facilitates efficient monitoring and troubleshooting, while NTP ensures all devices have consistent timestamps essential for audits and event correlation. SSH provides a secure method for remote access, safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized interception.
Tools and Frameworks Used
•	Packet Tracer: A network simulation tool used for configuring and testing Cisco routers.
•	Cisco IOS Commands: Utilized for executing configurations on routers.
Project Description
The project commenced with the configuration of Cisco routers (R1, R2, and R3) to enhance their functionalities through Syslog, NTP, and SSH. Below is a breakdown of the key configurations performed:
Topology and Addressing Table:
•	Configured three routers (R1, R2, and R3) with respective IP addresses, ensuring connectivity within the network.
•	Addressing details included IPs for interfaces and connected PCs (PC-A, PC-B, and PC-C).
Objective 1: Configure OSPF MD5 Authentication
1.	OSPF Configuration: Established OSPF routing protocol with MD5 authentication for secure routing updates across all routers in area 0.
2.	Key Configuration: Set the MD5 key (MD5pa55) on the relevant serial interfaces to ensure secure routing communication.
3.	Verification: Verified configurations and connectivity using the command show ip ospf interface.
Objective 2: Configure NTP
1.	NTP Setup: Configured R1, R2, and R3 as NTP clients, pointing them to the NTP server (PC-A) for accurate time synchronization.
2.	NTP Authentication: Enabled NTP authentication on PC-A and configured routers to authenticate using key 1 and password (NTPpa55).
3.	Hardware Clock Update: Configured routers to periodically update their hardware clocks with NTP time.
4.	Verification: Used the command show ntp status to confirm NTP synchronization and show clock to verify hardware clock updates.
Objective 3: Configure Syslog
1.	Syslog Server Configuration: Configured routers to send log messages to a designated Syslog server (PC-B) and enabled timestamp services for accurate log entries.
2.	Logging Verification: Verified logging was active and examined log messages received by the Syslog server.
Objective 4: Configure SSH on R3
1.	Domain Name and User Setup: Configured a domain name (ccnasecurity.com) and created a local user (SSHadmin) with high privilege level and secure password (ciscosshpa55).
2.	VTY Lines Configuration: Set VTY lines to accept only SSH connections and configured mandatory login using local user accounts.
3.	RSA Key Generation: Erased existing RSA key pairs and generated a new 1024-bit RSA key for secure SSH communication.
4.	SSH Configuration Verification: Verified SSH settings and adjusted timeouts and authentication parameters for enhanced security.
5.	Connectivity Tests: Attempted to connect via Telnet (which failed) to confirm SSH-only access, then successfully connected to R3 using SSH from PC-C and R2.
Conclusion: The successful implementation of Syslog, NTP, and SSH across the routers resulted in a secure and efficient network management environment. The centralized logging provided by Syslog facilitates monitoring and troubleshooting, while NTP ensures accurate timekeeping critical for logging and audits. The SSH configuration enhances security by allowing secure remote access, eliminating the risks associated with unencrypted protocols. This project exemplifies best practices in network security configuration, vital for protecting organizational assets and ensuring operational integrity.
